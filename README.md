Abstract
Land-use and cover change (LUCC) models' performance is influenced by spatial characteristics that trigger the transformations. However, literature worldwide on LUCC modeling usually reports validation results for entire regions without considering the subregions/environments with significant differences in LUCC drivers. In this study, we compared the performance of three LUCC models, Geomod, Cellular Automata-Markov, and Land Change Modeler, for two subregions, rural and urbanized, in a region with rapid urban growth in west Mexico City. The models' performance were assessed by evaluating the concordance between the predicted and the reference map. We compared the percentage area of each land use class, generated confusion matrices, and used a pattern validation analysis and a performance assessment based on landscape metrics. We found that the agreement between predicted and observed land use varied with the subregion, reflecting the spatial differences. According to the overall results, it is preferable to regionalize the modeling to increase the performance. It is advisable to test different models for each region.

Highlights
· When conducting LUCC modeling, relevant distinctions should be made to incorporate subregions that exhibit differences in the drivers of LUCC change processes.

· LUCC model's performance differences exist between the urbanized and rural subregions with different spatial characteristics.

· It is advisable to compare different model outputs for each subregion to account for the uncertainty of the modeling exercises.
