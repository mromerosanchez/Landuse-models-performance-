# Landuse-models-performance-
We assessed the performance of three land-use change models, Geomod, Cellular Automata-Markov, and Land Change Modeler, for two environments, rural and urbanized, in a region with rapid urban growth. The model's output was validated by evaluating the concordance between predicted and a reference map of the same date. Also, we conducted a landscape metric-based performance evaluation by comparing the total area and several landscape metrics for the urban and no-urban classes calculated using the FRAGSTATS V4.2 program.  According to the results the concordance between predicted and observed land use varied depending on the environment evaluated. For the urbanized environment, Geomod underestimate urban growth, Cellular Automata-Markov underestimate it and LUCM almost agreed with the actual urban expansion, whereas for the rural environment, the three models underestimated urban growth. Significant performance differences for the three models were found between environments based on the statistical analysis performed.
